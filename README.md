# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, where I developed a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**. The dataset consists of petal and sepal measurements, which are used as features for classification.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the famous **Iris dataset**, containing:
- **150 samples** with **4 features** (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- **3 classes** representing different iris species

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Workflow
✅ **Data Loading & Exploration:** Checked for missing values and visualized class distributions using pair plots.  
✅ **Feature Scaling & Splitting:** Normalized data and split it into training and testing sets.  
✅ **Model Training:** Implemented **Random Forest Classifier** for species classification.  
✅ **Evaluation:** Measured performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.  
✅ **Predictions:** Tested the model on new data samples to ensure robustness.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** in predicting iris species.
- Gained insights into **feature importance** using model interpretation techniques.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with **classification models**.
- Improved skills in **EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation**.

## ⭐ Acknowledgment
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, providing valuable hands-on experience in **machine learning classification models**.
