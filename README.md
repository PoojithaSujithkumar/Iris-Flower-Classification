# Iris-Flower-Classification
Built a Random Forest Classifier to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica during my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The project involved data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation, strengthening my understanding of classification techniques.
